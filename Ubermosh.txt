--play Ubermosh sound--

Steam's discovery queue manages to periodically surprise me. In between
recommendations for esteemed titles like Hentai Loot Box Simulator or Hentai Vs
Furries, I'll come across the occasional hidden gem, such as Ubermosh: Omega. 

It's the perfect antidote to all of the bullshit seen in modern AAA gaming,
from the overly scripted intro sequences to the invasive microtransactions.
Here, it's just you, your saint, and the thousands of corpses that lie beneath
your feet.


The basic gameplay loop is extraordinarily simple. You select one of six
classes and create a basic loadout of powerups, ranging from shields to extra
lives. Once you're ready, you're thrown into a triangular arena. The goal?
Survive for 90 seconds while killing as many enemies as possible within that
timeframe.  

Positioning is key to survival in Ubermosh, as one mistake can easily result in
complete failure.
